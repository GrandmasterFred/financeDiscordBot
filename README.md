Discord bot to manage finance stuff and stuff 

This started out because I wanted an easy way to log my finances anywhere, and I cant be bothered to look for an app that works on desktop and phone.

As such, with the utilization of Discord.py, and the fact that discord works on both desktop and mobile, this is created. 

To do list:
1. Logging of financial usage/gains
2. Displaying past financial usage based on month/year/type
3. Financial analysis/ cost prediction
4. Per user google drive integration so a copy of the finances are available online?

To use, pull this repo, install the dependencies using pip and the requirement file, and add your bot token to the .env file (you have to make the .env file yourself)
